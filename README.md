Files created for the exercises of the node.js, react.js and ReactNative course "Semana Omnistack 11.0".

During this course I learned to develop an application from back-end to front-end, developing mobile and web interfaces.

The app, called 'Be the Hero', is a way to connect non-governmental organizations that need funding to 'heroes', that is, people willing to make donations. For instance, an NGO that takes care of animals that live on the street could post an incident like "little dog hit by a car, need funding for treatment". A user would access a list of incidents in his phone, select one that he is willing to help and send a message to this NGO to get more details.
